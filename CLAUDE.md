# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a C# .NET 9.0 client library for the BrickLink API. The project is focused on creating an MVP that provides authentication/authorization and catalog data access (sets and parts information). Order, Payment, and Account functionality are explicitly excluded from the MVP scope.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: .NET 9.0 Class Library
- **Language**: C# 12
- **HTTP Client**: System.Net.Http with custom DelegatingHandler for OAuth authentication
- **JSON Serialization**: System.Text.Json
- **Authentication**: OAuth 1.0a-like signature scheme with HMAC-SHA1
- **Testing**: xUnit (planned)
- **Documentation**: XML documentation comments

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Build in Release mode
dotnet build -c Release

# Restore NuGet packages
dotnet restore
```

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage and generate HTML report
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory:"./TestResults"
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
reportgenerator -reports:"./TestResults/**/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"./TestResults/coveragereport" -reporttypes:Html

# Run specific test project with coverage
dotnet test tests/BrickLink.Client.Tests --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory:"./TestResults"

# View coverage report (opens HTML report in default browser)
start ./TestResults/coveragereport/index.html    # Windows
open ./TestResults/coveragereport/index.html     # macOS
xdg-open ./TestResults/coveragereport/index.html # Linux
```

## Project Architecture

### Namespace Structure
- `BrickLink.Client` - Main client class and core functionality
- `BrickLink.Client.Auth` - OAuth authentication handler and related classes
- `BrickLink.Client.Models` - Data models for API resources (Order, Inventory, CatalogItem, etc.)
- `BrickLink.Client.Enums` - Enumeration types (OrderStatus, ItemType, etc.)
- `BrickLink.Client.Services` - Service classes for different API resource categories

### Key Components
- **BrickLinkClient** - Main entry point, configured with OAuth credentials
- **AuthenticationHandler** - Custom DelegatingHandler for OAuth 1.0a signature generation
- **ApiResponse<T>** - Generic wrapper for all API responses with metadata
- **Catalog Services** - Services for retrieving set and part information from BrickLink catalog

### Authentication Flow
The API uses a simplified OAuth 1.0a-like authentication where:
1. Consumer Key/Secret obtained from BrickLink developer registration
2. Access Token/Token Secret obtained after IP address registration
3. Each request requires HMAC-SHA1 signature with oauth_nonce and oauth_timestamp
4. Authentication is handled transparently by the AuthenticationHandler

## Data Type Mappings

Critical mappings for data integrity:
- **Financial values** → `decimal` (prevents floating-point errors)
- **Timestamps** → `DateTimeOffset` (preserves timezone info)
- **Identifiers** → `long` (accommodates large IDs)
- **Controlled vocabularies** → C# enums (compile-time safety)

## Code Coverage Requirements

### Coverage Tools Setup
```bash
# Install ReportGenerator globally (one-time setup)
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool

# Verify installation
reportgenerator -help
```

### Coverage Standards
- **Minimum Coverage**: 85% for all new code
- **Authentication Components**: 90% minimum (critical security code)
- **Public APIs**: 95% minimum (external-facing interfaces)
- **Exception Paths**: 100% (all error handling must be tested)

### Coverage Workflow Integration
Every task completion must include:
1. Running tests with coverage collection
2. Generating HTML coverage report (for local development)
3. Reviewing coverage metrics in browser
4. Meeting minimum coverage thresholds before commit
5. Including coverage summary in commit message when relevant

**Note**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline uses Codecov for automated coverage reporting and PR status checks. Local HTML reports are for development verification only.

### Coverage Report Structure
- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of executed code lines
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of executed decision paths
- **Method Coverage**: Percentage of methods with at least one test
- **Class Coverage**: Percentage of classes with test coverage

### Exclusions from Coverage
- Auto-generated code (marked with `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]`)
- Model classes with only properties (data transfer objects)
- Explicit interface implementations that delegate to main implementation

## Development Environment

- **Platform**: Windows
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extension
- **Directory**: `C:\code\ClaudeCode\bricklink-client-claude`
- **Git Status**: Not currently a git repository

## Current Permissions

Claude Code has limited bash permissions configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`:
- `dir` command access
- `ls` command access  
- `find` command access

Additional permissions may need to be granted for .NET CLI operations.

## MVP Scope

**Included:**
- OAuth 1.0a-like authentication system
- Catalog item retrieval (parts, sets, minifigures)
- Set contents (subsets) and part usage (supersets)
- Price guide information
- Color and category reference data
- Item mapping between BrickLink and LEGO Element IDs

**Excluded:**
- Order management
- Payment processing
- Account management
- Inventory management (for store owners)
- Webhook/push notifications

## Development Principles

### Atomic Development & Single Responsibility
Every task and commit should follow these core principles:

- **Atomic Units of Work** - Each task should represent a single, complete unit of functionality that can be developed, tested, and committed independently
- **Single Responsibility** - Each class, method, and commit should have one clear purpose and reason to change
- **Incremental Progress** - Build functionality incrementally, with each step being a working, testable improvement
- **Clear Boundaries** - Separate concerns cleanly (authentication, models, services, etc.) with well-defined interfaces

### Task Workflow
When working on tasks from `docs/tasks.md`, follow this strict workflow:

#### Before Starting Any Task:
1. **Pull Latest Changes** - Always start with `git pull origin main` to ensure you have the latest code
2. **Create Feature Branch** - Create a new branch using the naming convention: `feature/task-description` or `feature/milestone-X-task-name`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/implement-authentication-handler
   ```
3. **Verify Clean State** - Ensure working directory is clean and on the correct branch

#### During Task Development:
1. **One Task, One Branch** - Each task gets its own dedicated feature branch
2. **Complete Implementation** - Don't leave tasks partially implemented
3. **Test Coverage** - Include comprehensive unit tests for each new piece of functionality
4. **Documentation** - Update XML docs and README as functionality is added
5. **Clean Code** - Follow C# coding conventions and ensure code is self-documenting

#### After Task Completion:
1. **Run Full Test Suite** - Execute all tests to ensure nothing is broken
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```
2. **Generate Coverage Report** - Run tests with coverage and generate HTML report
   ```bash
   dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory:"./TestResults"
   reportgenerator -reports:"./TestResults/**/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"./TestResults/coveragereport" -reporttypes:Html
   ```
3. **Review Coverage Report** - Open and review the HTML coverage report to ensure adequate test coverage
   ```bash
   start ./TestResults/coveragereport/index.html  # Windows
   ```
4. **Coverage Requirements** - Ensure minimum 85% code coverage for new code, 90% for critical authentication components
5. **Build Verification** - Ensure code compiles successfully in Release mode
   ```bash
   dotnet build -c Release
   ```
6. **Commit Changes** - Make a single, atomic commit for the completed task with coverage results
7. **Push Branch** - Push the feature branch to remote repository
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/task-name
   ```
8. **Create Pull Request** - Create a PR from the feature branch to main
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "feat: [Task Description]" --body "Completes task: [task description]
