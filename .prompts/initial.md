I'm looking to start a new C# .Net 9.0 Client libary for the BRicklink API.  This will be an MVP project, focused on authentication/authorization, a simple consumer pattern, and retreving set and part information.  The initial scope does not need to include any Order, Payment, or Account functionality.

In the docs directory is the API specification for the Bricklink API.  The goal is to create a client library that can be used to interact with the Bricklink API in a simple and intuitive way.

In the docs directory create a tasks.md file with high level milestones broken down into individual tasks to complete the MVP.  No coding should be completed yet
